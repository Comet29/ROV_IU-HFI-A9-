IMU: Use the ROS IMU (HFI-A9) to return internal transmission data (acceleration, angular velocity, Euler angles, and magnetic field). You need to check the connection method yourself.
ROV IU: Use Python to continuously plot acceleration and angular velocity data in real-time charts, and create a 3D model controlled by Euler angles.
